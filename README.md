    ASSESSMENT FEEDBACK 360 DEGREE SYSTEMS
</p>

## WHAT IS A SYSTEMS 360° FEEDBACK?
360 degree feedback is a systematic tool for personal development. The feedback focuses on behavior at work – specific skills and competencies. Based on the results, individual development plans can be created. 360° feedback can be used to identify and recognize strengths and weaknesses and can serve as a starting point for better work effectiveness.

In the 360° feedback the inputs originate from many directions (superiors, colleagues, subordinates or internal and external customers) in a structured way along with relevant competencies, helping us successfully map the employee’s potential.
